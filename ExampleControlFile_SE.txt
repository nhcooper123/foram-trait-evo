################################################################################

expectedNumberOfShifts = 1.0
# prior on the number of shifts in diversification
# Suggested values: 
#     expectedNumberOfShifts = 1.0 for small trees (< 500 tips)
#	  expectedNumberOfShifts = 10 or even 50 for large trees (> 5000 tips) 
# We recommend that researchers consider performing BAMM analyses using several values of
# including expectedNumberOfShifts = 100, to assess whether their results are robust to
# the prior
# ???? TINKER ?????

# Use setBAMMpriors function to empirical estimate suitable priors.
# It sets a relatively flat prior on lambdaInit, betaInit, and muInit. 
# It also sets a much more informative prior on those same parameters for the root process.
# To set the main lambdaInit and muInit priors, setBAMMpriors first estimates the rate of 
# speciation for your full tree under a pure birth model of diversification. We assume,    
# arbitrarily, that a reasonable prior distribution for the initial rate parameters is an 
# exponential distribution with a mean five times greater than this pure birth value.
# We also apply a separate prior distribution to the process at the root of the tree as 
# the root process is more sensitive to prior parameterization than any other processes. 
# Hence, we set the mean of the prior distributions for rate parameters on the root 
# process to exactly equal the pure birth rate. This is a conservative choice and probably 
# reduces the probability of detecting weak rate heterogeneity through time. At the same 
# time, it reduces the probability of detecting spurious declines in diversification 
# attributable to misspecified priors.

# For betaInitPrior and betaInitRootPrior, we find the maximum likelihood estimate of the 
# variance parameter under a Brownian motion model. 

# For the shift parameters (lambdaShiftPrior etc), the prior distribution is normal with a 
# mean of zero. For setBAMMpriors, we arbitrarily chose a prior distribution with
# a standard deviation s such that 2s gives a parameter that results in either a 90% 
# decline in the evolutionary rate or a 190% increase in rate on the interval of time from 
# the root to the tips of the tree. If T is the root age of the tree (time before present)
# this value is computed as z = log(0.1)/T. The standard deviation parameter for the prior 
# is just the value of s for which 2s gives z.

lambdaInitPrior = 1.0
# Prior (rate parameter of exponential) on the initial lambda value for rate
# regimes

lambdaShiftPrior = 0.05
# Prior (std dev of normal) on lambda shift parameter for rate regimes

# equal to a constant rate diversification process)
